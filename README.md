# RoboticArm
Robotic arm performs pick and place task in Unity 3D using deep reinforcement learning

In this respiratory, examples from my master thesis are represented. The codes are written in C# to control the training process of a robotic arm that was simulated in Unity 3D.
The respiratory includes the following files: 
•	Grabber controller that controls the gripping process of the robotic arm. 
•	Pick and place video that shows the results of the training.
•	Domain randomization controller that randomizes the simulation environment at the beginning of each training task. 
•	A picture that shows the randomized values at the beginning of each training task.
•	Pdf copy of my master thesis.
